## Algorithms in Code

* Clearly defined problem statment, input and output.
* The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order.
* The steps also need to be distinct
* The algorithm should produce a result
* The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time


## Correctness or Efficiency

Proof thorough induction or mathematical analysis. Fopr any possible input the output we expect, terrminate or end. 
Traditionally "correctness" is proved by mathematic reasoning to verify that the algorithm is correct. Specification proof.
Efficiency matters because helps solves problems faster and creates better end user experience. Measure of efficiency by
time and space complexity. Time complexitiy by how long it takes the algorithm to run - running time. Space complexity by how much memory
is taken up by the algorithm - deemed useful for large data sets.
